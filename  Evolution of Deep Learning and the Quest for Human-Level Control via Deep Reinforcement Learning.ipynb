    "Despite the seemingly futuristic and complex nature of the term 'Deep Learning,' its roots can be traced back to 1940 with the pioneering work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. They laid the foundation for neural networks with their influential paper titled 'A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity.' However, progress in neural networks faced challenges for decades due to limitations in computing power and data availability. It wasn't until the early 21st century that significant advancements reignited interest, with a transformative moment occurring in 2012 during the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pivotal moment was characterized by the breakthrough achieved by a team led by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. They demonstrated a groundbreaking leap in image classification accuracy using a deep neural network architecture known as AlexNet. This success marked the resurgence of deep learning, showcasing its superior capabilities in handling complex tasks.\n",

    "The landscape of deep learning further evolved with the introduction of reinforcement learning techniques, notably highlighted by DeepMind's Deep Q-Learning algorithm. In particular, Deep Q-Learning garnered attention with its remarkable performance in the game of Breakout. DeepMind demonstrated the ability of the algorithm to achieve superhuman performance by learning optimal strategies through reinforcement learning.\n",

The primary objective is to achieve a greater understanding not only of reinforcement learning but also of the broader topic of deep learning. The reason I chose this particular paper and topic is that this type of deep learning architecture can serve as a valuable case study for its success in achieving human-level performance in complex tasks. Deep Q-Learning, proposed by researchers at DeepMind, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in mastering complex environments through reinforcement learning. By replicating and dissecting the nuances of this algorithm, I aim to unravel insights into the principles of reinforcement learning and the intricate mechanisms that contribute to the success of deep learning models.\n",

The agent even surpasses human expert players in some of those games! This is an astonishing result because previously “AIs” used to be limited to one single game, for instance, chess, whereas in this case the types and contents of the games in the Arcade Learning Environment vary significantly and yet no adjustment of the architecture, learning algorithm or hyperparameters is needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, a neural network learns to map inputs to outputs based on labeled training data. For instance, in classifying cats and dogs, the network is trained with labeled images until it can accurately classify new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the approach is more akin to a child learning a new game. The computer explores the environment, receives occasional rewards when the score increases, and learns to make decisions by evaluating actions that lead to higher scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to supervised learning, reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges with \"sparse\" and \"delayed\" rewards, as mentioned by [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602). \"Sparse\" implies infrequent rewards, and \"delayed\" refers to the significant time gap between an action and the corresponding reward. In RL scenarios, the agent might not receive feedback immediately after making a decision, making it challenging to associate actions with their eventual outcomes. For instance, in a maze, choosing a path at a fork may not yield immediate feedback; the reward, finding gold, comes later. To address this, RL uses a discount factor $\\gamma$ to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept introduced by Sutton and Barto in 2018 on page 55 is that of \"discounting\" in the context of reinforcement learning. In this approach, the agent aims to select actions to maximize the sum of the discounted rewards it receives over the future. Specifically, it chooses an action $A_t$ to maximize the \"expected discounted return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discounted return $G_t$ is calculated as follows  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "G_{t} &= R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ... \\\\\n",
    "&=R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\bigl(R_{t+2} + \\gamma R_{t+3} + ...\\bigr)\\\\\n",
    "&= R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_t$ is the reward the agent received at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_t$ is the reward received at time $t+i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma$ is the discount factor between 0 and 1, and andThe summation represents the accumulation of future rewards, each discounted by a factor of $\\gamma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation allows the agent to prioritize more immediate rewards over those in the distant future, helping in decision-making processes where the consequences of actions unfold over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors furthermore explain:\n",
    "\n",
    ">a reward received $k$ time steps in the future is worth only $\\gamma^{k−1}$ times what it would be worth if it were received immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    ">As $\\gamma$ approaches 1, the return objective takes future rewards into account more strongly; the agent becomes more farsighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at a very simple example where there is just one reward not equal to 0 (calculate from right to left):\n",
    "\n",
    "time $t$ |  0| 1 | 2|3|4|\n",
    ":---| --- | ---| ---|---|---|\n",
    "reward sequence $R_t$|  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "discounted returns $G_t$| $\\gamma^3$ | $\\gamma^2$ | $\\gamma$ | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "for $\\gamma=0.9$|0.729 | 0.81 | 0.9| 1 |0|\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor detail: In this example there is no reward at $t=0$ because the first reward $R_1$ is a result of action $a_0$ taken in state $s_0$ and the reward is always associated with the next state in Sutton and Barto. Some articles associate the reward $R_i$ with the state $s_i$ and action $a_i$ that caused the reward. In that case the definition of the discounted return changes to $G_t=R_{t} + \\gamma G_{t+1}$, in the table the 1's would all be in the same column and there would be a reward equal to 0 at $t=0$ but not at $t=4$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, by discounting returns, future rewards increase past or current returns and the closer $\\gamma$ is to 1, the farther the agent can *see* into the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "And *sparse*?\n",
    "In our fictive maze example, the rewards are the sparser, the less gold you find. For an agent, a game is more difficult to learn, the sparser the reward is. \"Pong\" is one of the games DQN can learn fastest because the score changes quite often. \"Montezuma's Revenge\", on the other hand, has very sparse rewards and DQN (at least without some additional tricks) is not able to learn the game at all.\n",

    "### 3.2 Q-learning in Deep Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does Q-learning work? If the agent (regardless if trained or still untrained) is shown a state $s$ of the game, it has to decide which action $a$ to perform (for example move paddle left or right in breakout). How does it do that? On page 2 [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) define the so-called $Q$-Function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">We define the optimal action-value function $Q^∗(s, a)$ as the maximum expected return achievable by following any strategy, after seeing some sequence $s$ and then taking some action $a$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that given a state of the game $s$ (for now please consider *sequences* as states of the game), $Q^*(s,a)$ is the best (discounted) total return the agent can achieve if it performs action $a$ in the current state $s$. So how does it choose which action to perform assuming we already know $Q^*(s,a)$? One obvious strategy would be to always choose the action with the maximum value of $Q^*$ (we will see later, why this is slightly problematic). But first of all, we need to find this magical function $Q^*$:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are in state $s$, decide to perform action $a$, and arrive in the next state $s'$. If we assume that in state $s'$ the $Q^*$-values for all possible actions $a'$ were already known, then the $Q^*$-value in state $s$ for action $a$ (action-value in $s$ for action $a$) would be the reward $r$ we got for performing action $a$ plus the discounted maximum future return in $s'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q^*(s,a) = r + \\gamma \\textrm{max}\\left( Q^*(s',a') \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Less formal but more intuitive:\n",
    "If we were at a certain fork in the maze (state $s$) and want to know how good it was to choose the left path (perform action $a$), we add the gold we found after going left (reward we received for performing action $a$) and the amount of gold we expect to find down the road (maximum future discounted return). If you have to choose between finding a golden coin immediately after going left at a fork but nothing else down the road or finding nothing immediatley after going right but a treasure down the road, well, the right path is worth more/has a higher action-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the so-called **Bellman equation**. Deep Q-Learning uses a neural network to find an approximation $Q(s,a,\\theta)$ of $Q^*(s,a)$. $\\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network. We will discuss later, how exactly the parameters of the network are updated. Now, I will explain, how the neural network maps a state $s$ to $Q$-values for the possible actions $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier I mentioned, that I regard a *sequence* as a *state*. What did I mean with that? Imagine you have a pin-sharp image of a flying soccer ball. Can you tell in which direction it moves? No, you cannot, but you could if there was some kind of motion blur in the picture or if you had several images taken quickly one after another showing the ball in a slightly different position every time. The same problem occurs in Atari games. From a single frame of the game \"Pong\", the agent can not discern in which direction the ball moves. DeepMind met this problem by stacking several consecutive frames and considering this sequence a state that is passed to the neural network. From such a sequence the agent is able to detect the direction and speed of movement because the ball is in a different position in each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since the agent only observes images of the current screen [...] it is impossible to fully understand the current situation from only the current screen $x_t$. We therefore consider sequences of actions and observations, $s_t = x_1, a_1, x_2, ..., a_{t−1}, x_t$, and learn game strategies that depend upon these sequences. All sequences in the emulator are assumed to terminate in a finite number of time-steps. This formalism gives rise to a large but finite Markov decision process (MDP) in which each sequence is a distinct state. ([page 2 of Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On page 5 of [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) the authors explain the preprocessing of the frames:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Working directly with raw Atari frames, which are 210 × 160 pixel images with a 128 color palette, can be computationally demanding, so we apply a basic preprocessing step aimed at reducing the input dimensionality. The raw frames are preprocessed by first converting their RGB representation to gray-scale and down-sampling it to a 110×84 image. The final input representation is obtained by cropping an 84 × 84 region of the image that roughly captures the playing area. The final cropping stage is only required because we use the GPU implementation of 2D convolutions from [...], which expects square inputs. For the experiments in this paper, the function $\\phi$ [...] applies this preprocessing to the last 4 frames of a history and stacks them to produce the input to the $Q$-function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us start by looking at how the preprocessing can be implemented. I used `gym` from OpenAi to provide the environment. A frame returned by the environment has the shape `(210,160,3)` where the 3 stands for the RGB color channels. Such a frame is passed to the Functor`FrameProcessor` which transforms it to a `(84,84,1)` frame, where the 1 indicates that instead of three RGB channels there is one grayscale channel. \n"

    "One other interesting thing to notice: DeepMind uses the quadratic cost function with error clipping (see page 7 of [Mnih et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236/)).\n",
    "\n",
    ">We also found it helpful to clip the error term from the update [...] to be between -1 and 1. Because the absolute value loss function |x| has a derivative of -1 for all negative values of x and a derivative of 1 for all positive values of x, clipping the squared error to be between -1 and 1 corresponds to using an absolute value loss function for errors outside of the (-1,1) interval. This form of error clipping further improved the stability of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this improve the stability of the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    ">In deep networks or recurrent neural networks, error gradients can accumulate during an update and result in very large gradients. These in turn result in large updates to the network weights, and in turn, an unstable network. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values. [Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/exploding-gradients-in-neural-networks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This so-called exploding gradient problem can, to some extent, be avoided by clipping the gradients to a certain threshold value, if they exceed it: * If the true gradient is larger than a critical value $x$, just assume it is $x$.* Observe that the derivate of the green curve does not increase (or decrease) for $x>1$ (or $x<-1$).\n",
    "Error clipping can be easily implemented in tensorflow by using the Huber loss function `tf.losses.huber_loss`.\n",
